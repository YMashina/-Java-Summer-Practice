### Description
User-friendly GUI application for visualisation of Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph.

### Features
* Simple
* Fast
* Intuitive
* Elegant

### Algorithm explanation

Amazingly simple explanation of the algorithm on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OQeCuLYj-4&feature=youtu.be).

### User interface
> Step 1: Choose the number of vertices in your graph

> Step 2: Fill the adjacency matrix for your graph. Bear in mind: algorithm will not work with graphs with negative cycles but the application will not crash if you input such graph.

![step 2](https://pp.userapi.com/c857532/v857532515/b490/gNigcJQA168.jpg)
> Step 3: Take a look at your graph. Quite pretty, isn't it? Though, you may still drag vertices if something is overlapped.
