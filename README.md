### Description
User-friendly GUI application for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

### Features
* Simple
* Fast
* Intuitive

### Algorithm explanation

Amazingly simple explanation of the algorithm on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OQeCuLYj-4&feature=youtu.be).

###User interface
> Step 1: Choose the number of vertices in your graph

> Step 2: Fill the adjacency matrix for your graph. Bear in mind: algorithm will not work with graphs with negative cycles but the application will not crash if you input such graph.

> Step 3: Take a look at your graph. Quite pretty, isn't it? Though, you may still drag vertices if something is overlapped.
